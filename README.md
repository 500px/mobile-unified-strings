# 500px Mobile App Strings

This repository contains all the strings in every language we suppport in 500px mobile applications, both Android and iOS. The `master.txt` was generated with our fork of https://github.com/500px/twine. For details about how we generated this file please see [Consolidating string resources across Android & iOS](https://developers.500px.com/consolidating-string-resources-across-android-ios-468932b84ccf#.hf2tmombd)

## How to submit a translation correction

If you're familiar with `git` clone this repository, update the `master.txt` in separate branch, and submit a pull request.

If you're not familiar with `git`
- You would need to [create](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) Github account
- Point your browser to https://github.com/500px/mobile-unified-strings/blob/master/master.txt
- Click on **Edit this file** (pencil) button
- Make your changes
- When you're ready, provide brief summary of your changes and optional longer explanation with more context
- Pick **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.**
- Click **Commit changes**

After your pull request has been merged you'll see your translations in future release. This might take up-to 15 days.

## How to add new language

You can do that above for every key, however it would probably be much easier to do it by cloning the repository. If you're not familiar with `git` and `Github` there is very nice [15 minute tutorial](https://try.github.io/) to get started.
